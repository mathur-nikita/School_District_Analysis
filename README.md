Maria has been tasked with analyzing information about standardized test data to help facilitate informed discussions surrounding standardized testing in schools and school funding.  During this process the school board has determined there is evidence of academic dishonesty, and Maria has asked us to help remove the compromised data and rework the analysis.

### Resources
