# School District Analysis

## Overview

### Purpose

Maria has been tasked with analyzing information about standardized test data to help facilitate informed discussions surrounding standardized testing in schools and school funding.  During this process the school board has determined there is evidence of academic dishonesty, and Maria has asked us to help remove the compromised data and rework the analysis.

### Resources

- Python, pandas, numpy
- schools_complete.csv
- students_complete.csv

## Results

### How is the district summary affected?

Old district summary:

New district summary:

As seen above, there is a slight difference between the old and new district summaries.  The average math scores, passing math percentages, passing reading percentages, and overall passing percentages had small decreases.

### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

Old top and bottom 5 schools:

New top and bottom 5 schools:
![high_low_performing_schools.JPG](https://github.com/mathur-nikita/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/screenshots/high_low_performing_schools.JPG)

While the average math and reading scores and the percentage of passing math and reading scores for Thomas High School decreased, the decrease was tiny and did not affect the overall ranking of Thomas High School in comparison to the other schools.

### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
 
#### Math and reading scores by grade

Old math scores by grade:

New math scores by grade:

Old reading scores by grade:

Replacing the ninth-grade scores did not affect the math and reading scores of the other grades at Thomas High School.  It also did not impact the other schools.  The tables above show that only the ninth-grade scores of Thomas High School students were impacted.

#### Scores by school spending

Old scores by school spending:

New scores by school spending:

As can be seen above, removing ninth-grade scores had no impact on school spending.

#### Scores by school size

Old scores by school size:

New scores by school size:
![size_summary.JPG](https://github.com/mathur-nikita/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/screenshots/size_summary.JPG)

As can be seen above, removing ninth-grade scores had no impact on overall scores by school size.

#### Scores by school type

Old scores by school type:

New scores by school type:

As can be seen above, removing ninth-grade scores had no impact on overall scores by type of school.
